<h1>About This Gallery</h1>

<p>
This website is a static prototype character gallery focused on famous
video game characters. I chose this theme because video games have
recognizable heroes across many genres and franchises.
</p>

<p>
The design uses a card grid layout to keep the gallery neat and readable.
Each character shows a summary and links to a shared details page.
This project demonstrates static web structure, navigation design,
and basic layout styling.
